        <p>
          Hello! I am a dedicated and experienced civil engineer with a passion
          for construction and project management. With a solid background in
          overseeing various construction projects, I have acquired valuable
          skills and knowledge that enable me to excel in the field. From
          January 2020 to December 2020, I had the opportunity to work at
          Aswathy Gardens Limited, a reputable construction company. During my
          tenure there, I played a pivotal role in the construction of numerous
          villas. My responsibilities included overseeing critical aspects such
          as brickwork, plastering, concreting, and other essential construction
          tasks. This experience allowed me to gain hands-on knowledge of the
          construction process and the intricacies involved in delivering
          high-quality projects. Following my successful stint at Aswathy
          Gardens Limited, I joined Radianz in January 2021. While working at
          Radianz, I had the privilege of supervising the construction of a
          remarkable 20-floor building. This project provided me with an
          opportunity to further refine my project management skills, as I
          navigated the complexities of overseeing a large-scale construction
          endeavor. Continuing my professional growth, I then joined
          Putribuilders as a civil engineer. Due to my dedication and strong
          performance, I was soon promoted to the role of Team Lead. As a Team
          Lead, I efficiently managed a group of talented professionals,
          fostering a collaborative work environment and ensuring the successful
          completion of various projects. Throughout my career, I have developed
          a deep understanding of construction methodologies, industry
          standards, and regulatory requirements. I am adept at utilizing my
          technical expertise to solve complex problems, coordinate with diverse
          stakeholders, and deliver projects within designated timelines and
          budgets. I thrive in fast-paced environments, and my excellent
          organizational and communication skills allow me to effectively manage
          multiple tasks simultaneously. I am a detail-oriented professional,
          known for my meticulous approach to quality assurance and my
          commitment to delivering exceptional results. In summary, I am a
          skilled civil engineer with a solid foundation in construction project
          management. With my proven track record of successfully overseeing
          projects and my passion for excellence, I am confident in my ability
          to contribute significantly to any construction team.
